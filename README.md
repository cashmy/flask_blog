# Flask_Blog üöÄ

Welcome to Flask_Blog! This project was developed as a way to get re-acquainted with the Flask web framework, building upon an older tutorial originally designed for Flask version 1 and Bootstrap version 4. It has since been updated and modernized with newer technologies.

As someone with extensive experience in Django, this project served as a practical exercise to explore the nuances of Flask and integrate modern Python development tools.

Note: This project is not intended for production use; it is a learning exercise and should be treated as such. However it is at a stage where it can be deployed for educational purposes or as a starting point for further development.

## Key Updates and Modernizations üõ†Ô∏è

The original project underwent several key modifications:

* **Framework & Language Update:** Migrated from Flask 1 to **Flask 3.1.1** and **Python 3.12.4**.
* **Frontend Styling:** Upgraded from Bootstrap 4 to **Bootstrap 5**.
* **Development Environment:** Incorporated **UV** for robust virtual environment management and package installation.
* **Code Quality:** Integrated **Ruff** for comprehensive linting and code formatting, ensuring consistency and maintainability.
* **Enhanced CLI Output:** Utilized the **Rich** package for improved visual feedback in the terminal, notably for displaying the project's directory structure.

## Tech Stack üíª

* **Backend:** Python 3.12.4, Flask 3.1.1
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5
* **Templating:** Jinja2
* **Virtual Environment & Packaging:** UV
* **Linting & Formatting:** Ruff
* **CLI Enhancement:** Rich
* **Database:** SQLite (as indicated by `site.db` in the project structure)

## Project Structure Overview üìÇ

A custom script `tree.py` (utilizing the `Rich` library) was created to visualize the project's directory structure in the terminal. Here's an example of its output:
